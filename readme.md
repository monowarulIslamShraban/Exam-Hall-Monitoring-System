# 📷 Exam Hall Monitoring System

An AI-powered real-time surveillance system designed to detect and alert on rule violations in examination halls. This project utilizes an ESP32-S3 camera module for video streaming and a Python-based YOLOv3 object detection pipeline to identify suspicious activities.

> 🛠️ **Project completed as part of CSE461 (Intro to Robotics) in Fall 2024.**

## 🔍 Overview

The system captures live video streams from an ESP32-S3 camera module and processes them using a Python script that employs the YOLOv3 object detection algorithm. Upon detecting any rule violations, such as unauthorized objects or behaviors, the system:

- Captures a screenshot of the incident.
- Activates a buzzer and a red LED indicator connected to the ESP32 module.

## 🧰 Features

- **Live Video Streaming:** Real-time video feed from the ESP32-S3 camera.
- **Object Detection:** Utilizes YOLOv3 to identify potential rule violations.
- **Alert Mechanism:** Triggers auditory and visual alerts upon detection.
- **Incident Logging:** Captures and stores images of detected violations for review.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Hardware:**
  - ESP32-S3 camera module
  - Buzzer and red LED indicator
- **Software:**
  - Arduino IDE with ESP32 board support
  - Python 3.x
  - Required Python libraries:
    - `opencv-python`
    - `numpy`

### Setup Instructions

1. **ESP32-S3 Camera Module:**
   - Open `CamWebServer.ino` in Arduino IDE.
   - Replace `WIFI_NAME` and `WIFI_PASSWORD` with your network credentials.
   - Upload the sketch to the ESP32-S3 module.

2. **Python Environment:**
   - Ensure `yolov3.cfg`, `yolov3.weights`, and `coco.names` are in the same directory as `detector.py`.
   - Install required Python libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install opencv-python numpy
     ```

3. **Running the Detection Script:**
   - Execute `detector.py`:
     ```bash
     python detector.py
     ```

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Video Streaming:**
   - The ESP32-S3 module streams video over Wi-Fi. ([abrarhussien/examination-system--JS: demo - GitHub](https://github.com/abrarhussien/examination-system--JS?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

2. **Processing & Detection:**
   - The Python script captures the video stream.
   - Each frame is analyzed using YOLOv3 to detect predefined objects or behaviors indicative of rule violations.

3. **Alert Mechanism:**
   - Upon detection:
     - A screenshot is saved.
     - The ESP32 module is signaled to activate the buzzer and illuminate the red LED.

## 🧪 Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced Detection:**
  - Train YOLOv3 on custom datasets specific to examination scenarios.
- **Web Interface:**
  - Develop a dashboard to monitor live feeds and review logged incidents.
- **Cloud Integration:**
  - Store incident logs and images in cloud storage for centralized access.
- **Multi-Camera Support:**
  - Extend support for monitoring multiple examination halls simultaneously. ([muhammadraza77/Exam-Surveillance - GitHub](https://github.com/muhammadraza77/Exam-Surveillance?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
